Statements:
1. All the 32-bit instructions are aligned by 32.
2. All the 32-bit instructions have their lowest two bits set to 11.
3. All zeros and all ones are illegal kinds of instructions.
4. ISA has little-endian memory system.
5.
a) Exception - unusual condition occurring at run time associated with an instruction in the current RISC-V thread.
b) Trap - the synchronous transfer of control to a trap handler caused by an exceptional condition occurring within a RISC-V thread.
c) Interrupt - external event that occurs asynchronously to the current RISC-V thread.
6. There are 32 general-pupose registers x0-x31 and PC.
7. Four core instructions formats: R / I / S / U.
8. An instruction address misaligned exception is generated on a taken branch or unconditional jump if the target address is not four-byte aligned.
No instruction fetch misaligned exception is generated for a conditional branch that is not taken.
9. The sign bit for all immediates is always in bit 31 of the instruction to speed sign-extension circuitry.
10. Two immediate instructions formats: B (coupled with S) / J (coupled with U).
11. Integer compuration instructions: I or R. No integer computational instructions cause arithmetic exceptions.
12. No support for overflow checks on integer arithmetic operations.
